## ðŸ“œ Project Description
-
    This project is a frontend built using Astro, a modern static site generator that focuses on delivering highly optimized web pages by default. Astro allows for the seamless integration of multiple front-end frameworks while providing a simplified development experience. To style the application, Sass is used, a powerful CSS preprocessor that offers advanced features like variables, mixins, and nested rules, which greatly enhance the efficiency of writing and maintaining CSS.

    TypeScript is utilized throughout the project to ensure the development of scalable, maintainable, and robust applications. With TypeScript's type safety and advanced tooling support, this project guarantees fewer runtime errors and better code organization.

    The combination of Astro's performance-first philosophy, Sass's powerful styling capabilities, and TypeScript's reliability results in a highly optimized and maintainable front-end solution.
